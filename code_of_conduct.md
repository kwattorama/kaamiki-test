#Kaamiki Code of Conduct#

We do not publish this code because we fear inappropriate behavior, but because we already appreciate and love the extraordinary respect and values of our team. This is the basis on which we are building our Code of Conduct. We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, harassment-free and healthy environment for everyone, regardless of level of experience and education.

We believe that the mutual articulation of our values and responsibilities gives us a clear direction if there are any deviations in the future. We are all committed to implementing and developing this Code of Conduct as our team (and customer base) grows.

As community members, contributors and maintainers of this project, we commit to respect all people who participate in the community through reporting issues, posting feature requests, updating documentation, submitting pull requests or patches, and other activities.

The Code of Conduct applies in particular to team interaction, including all events hosted/conducted by Kaamiki, chat and video conferences, social media communication, pull request feedback, participation in open source projects, communication with our team (and customers) and at conferences or events where we represent Kaamiki.

##Our standards


###Don't just support your colleagues on demand, be proactive. Offer your help if you notice that a team member is struggling with a problem or otherwise needs help. Be careful not to be too patronizing or disrespectful. When someone turns to you for help, always be open, listen and try to put yourself in the position of your counterpart. If you don't have time because of a deadline, let the person know and tell them openly when you have time or maybe refer a team member who is just as familiar with the topic.


*Expected behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:*


- Clearly convey what you want, avoid acronyms and jargon if not everyone can understand in conversation.Be inclusive

-Share your insights early to get feedback quickly. Don't just ask for feedback, but also give it back to the team. Your feedback should be friendly, respectful, clear, constructive, and focused on goals and values rather than personal preferences. Thank you for the feedback.

-Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people. Be polite and friendly in all forms of communication. Avoid sarcasm or explicitly add a #sarcasm hashtag to your statement to avoid misunderstandings. If required use Emojis or GIFs to avoid miscommunication in written form of communication, but don't tend to communicate only in pictures, but use them consciously and moderately.

-Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences

-Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience

-Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

**Do whatever you want to achieve our goal. Just mind the consequences.**

*Examples of unacceptable behavior include:*

-The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind

-Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks

-Public or private harassment

-Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit 

permission

-Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

**Please, also take a notice that different people understand unacceptable behavior differently.**
